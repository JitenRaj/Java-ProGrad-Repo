Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and 
behaviors of the parent class. It’s essentially creating a parent-child 
relationship between classes. In Java, we will use inheritance mainly for 
code re-usability and maintainability.

Keyword “extends” is used to inherit a class in java. The “extends” keyword
indicates that we are making a new class that derives from an existing class.

In the terminology of Java, a class that is inherited is called a super class. 
The new class is called a subclass.

A subclass inherits all the non-private members (fields, methods, and nested classes) 
from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by 
subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

Inheritance types :

- Single Inheritance
- Multi Level Inheritance
- Hierarchical Inheritance

- Multiple & Hybrid Inheritance (Interfaces only)
